A simple TUI program for verifying MD5 checksums with multithreading.

This program was primarily created for fun and to verify FitGirl Repacks faster using multithreading â€” but mainly for fun.

It is not guaranteed to be fast or highly efficient. It was designed to suit my needs and visual preferences.
